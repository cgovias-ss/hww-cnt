    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Personas are a human-centred design technique that lets you understand your users better. Personas aren’t an exact and specific profile of your users. Instead, a persona is the characterisation of someone who represents a segment of your target audience.</p>
        <p>You may need to create several personas for a range of user needs, preferences, and thinking styles. Whatever you design must respond to those user needs to be useful to your target audience.</p>
        <p>User personas are a tool that can be used in the design process and describe the goals, behaviours, and challenges faced by a user group. Successful user personas are different from marketing personas which focus on user demographics.</p>
        <p><strong>Use this play to&#8230</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand who your users are and what their needs are.</li>
          <li>Make sure that users are considered throughout your design process.</li>
          <li>Generate ideas that are rooted in user needs.</li>
          <li>Help develop products and services that are more user-informed.</li>

          <h2>Why do I need personas?</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Personas help teams understand their users’ needs and behaviours. This allows you to develop greater empathy for your users throughout the design process. When you have a deep sense of who your users are, you can make design decisions based upon their needs.</p>
              <p>Effective personas align your team on who your users are and what they need. Personas do this by supplementing firsthand research with assumptions to create compelling representations of prospective users. Keeping these representations on hand help inform your team’s decisions. You can also use these personas to test prototypes.</p>
              <p>Personas help generate new ideas by putting yourself in your users’ shoes. You can apply personas at every step of the process:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Software teams: compare your in-progress flows and interfaces against the personas that relate to the problem you’re solving.</li>
                  <li>Policy teams: analyze the effects and predict the implications of your policy on the people you’re trying to help.</li>
                  <li>Program teams: check your program design with the stakeholders in your program ecosystem and be aware of the diversity amongst those stakeholders</li>

                <div class="col-md-12">
              <p>Personas can be a dynamic and compelling addition to a design process, but they can easily be misunderstood and misused. Personas aren’t a silver bullet to build better products. They aren’t an outcome or a final deliverable. They are one of several tools and techniques that help you to better understand your users by bringing them into your process so that you can help solve their problems.</p>
              <p>It’s important that you continually apply personas against the problem you’re trying to solve. They’re a way to test your solutions every step of the way. Otherwise, your personas are just data visualizations.</p>

              <ul>
                  <li>You don’t have research or evidence to inform and support assumptions. You should do research and speak to potential users first.</li>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h3>Step 1: Objectives and Planning</h3>
                    <p><strong>Determine the requirements for the persona(s):</strong></p>
                    <p>The first step is to determine why you need personas. There should be a specific need to make the most of the final product. Personas need to be context-specific. They should focus on the user behaviors and goals of a specific area of your product or service. Personas should not be reused by groups within the same organization that focus on different products/services. For example, an inspector will have different goals and needs during pre-inspection compared to later in their workflow.</p>
                    <p><strong>Determine the persona archetypes:</strong></p>
                    <p>A persona does not represent the entire population of your users. It needs to focus on a specific archetype of the user population. This is why you may need to create several personas to capture a greater representation of your users.</p>
                    <p>Each persona should represent different key goals and challenges that your product or service aims to solve. For example, previous research found that while TC inspectors have many similar job functions, they have different tools to when working on water, land, and in air. As such, the research team planned to interview marine, surface, and aviation inspectors to account for all environments.</p>
                    <p>The main difference between your persona archetypes should be behavioural characteristics, like differing needs, not demographic characteristics, like age. For example, if there are no age-specific goals or challenges faced by inspectors, then there is no need to create separate personas by age group.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Gathering evidence</h3>
                    <p>Once you’ve determined your objectives and your user groups, you’re ready to start collecting information for your personas.</p>
                    <p>To achieve the most accurate personas, the information you collect should come from user research. You can do this by conducting interviews with your users/user groups (see the play <a href="https://tc-ca.github.io/hww-cnt/plays/interview.html">Interviewing your users</a>). While it’s not always possible to do user research, it’s the gold standard. You should try to do user research to ensure accurate, validated personas.</p>
                    <p>If you can’t do user research, there’s still information that you can collect about your users through other means to create a preliminary persona. This could be gathering marketing data on your users, or interviewing stakeholders who know your users. Any other methods you can think of to learn about your users is valid. The personas you create from these sources can serve as a placeholder until you can do user research to validate your findings</p>
                <h3>Step 3: Creating the personas</h3>
                    <p>Once you’ve finished conducting your user research, you’ll have a large amount of data and findings. You’ll need to make decisions about what information is most relevant to your target audiences. You can still use Information you omit from your personas in other artifacts, like customer journey maps.</p>
                    <h4>What not to include in your persona(s)</h4>
                        <p>Your personas should be about one page each and should only include the necessary information.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-define-a-user-persona/">Career Foundry</a> mentions that:</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;As a rule of thumb, avoid adding extra details that cannot be used to influence the design. If it does not affect the final design or help make any decisions easier: omit it. While you do want to build up a realistic character, there’s no need to include pointless details that won’t influence the final design. If you’re designing a holiday-booking app, it doesn’t make sense to include information on Savannah’s favourite TV programs or what football team she supports. So, only include details that serve a design purpose!&rdquo;</p>
                    <h4>Persona outline and examples</h4>
                        <p>Renowned UX specialist Kim Goodwin outlines that personas should be &ldquo;1–2 page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment, with a few (very few!) fictional personal details to bring the persona to life&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p>Let’s break these sections down.</p>
                        <p><em>Behaviour patterns:</em> how does the person goes through their day. What’s their productivity ritual?</p>
                        <p><em>Goal and motivation:</em> what is the person trying to achieve, and why?</p>
                        <p><em>Needs:</em> what needs does the person have in the context of motivation and goal?</p>
                        <p><em>Tasks:</em> what kind of activities does the person carry out and why?</p>
                        <p><em>Skills:</em> what skills does the person have? How technologically literate are they? Are they an expert in Excel or do they spend most days writing?</p>
                        <p><em>Environment:</em>what is the person’s physical and social context?</p>
                        <p><em>Interaction/community:</em>who are the people and communities the person is interacting with, and why?</p>
                        <p><em>Fictional personal details:</em>name, age, personality trait</p>
                    <h4>Validating personas</h4>
                        <p>Once you’ve created your first draft personas, you need to validate them with your users and stakeholders to ensure they’re accurate.</p>
                        <p>A great way of doing this is to use surveys to reach more users to confirm your findings. Surveys are quick and because they’re unmoderated, you can send a survey to many more users than you would reach through interviews.</p>
                        <p>Other ways to validate your personas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Get wider subject matter expert approval</em> &ndash; With your persona in hand, share it with as many subject matter experts as you can. See what feedback you receive, given their different expertise and backgrounds</li>
                            <li><em>Complexity</em> &ndash; Personas are a representation and as such, generalized and sometimes inaccurate. If you add more information and more accurate data, people will view your persona as fact rather than a guide. Don’t do this. Instead, keep your persona simple.</li>
                            <li><em>Use quantitative data</em> &ndash; if you include accurate quantitative information in your persona, validate the persona against the facts you collected during the process. Question everything.</li>
                            <li><em>Look for self-identification</em> &ndash; If you interviewed subject matter experts or users to generate your persona, interview users again after you’ve created your persona. Make sure that you interview the same and different users. See if they identify with one of the personas you have created. If none of your users identifies with a persona, then your persona isn’t valid. You’ll usually get one person who doesn’t identify with a persona. That’s ok.</li>
                        </ul>
                <h3>Step 4: Creating the personas</h3>
                        <p>Creating a persona scenario is a valuable way to see how people might use your solutions, based on their context, unique needs and motivations. Scenarios capture what users would likely experience as they proceed toward using an ideal solution.</p>
                        <p>Scenarios are a flexible tool for ideation, iteration, and usability testing. They often expose vital areas to test. Scenarios help teams discover user needs and can be used to keep stakeholders on track with a shared vision.</p>
                        <p>Scenarios can be highly visual narratives or simple written statements. Ensure you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Provide context</em> &ndash; this should include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Who &ndash; details of the persona</li>
                                    <li>What their goals are</li>
                                    <li>When they might perform tasks (including obstacles)</li>
                                    <li>Where they might do these (including obstacles)</li>
                                    <li>Why they want to do things</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li><em>Focus on the bigger picture</em> &ndash; what leads up to the interaction, what impact the user’s world and influences how they interact with a solution (e.g. cultural context), and what they need before using the solution (e.g. information).</li>
                            <li><em>Make the scenario simple for people without technical backgrounds</em> &ndash; This allows everyone including stakeholders to relate to the scenario.</li>
                            <li><em>Keep the scenario centered on the user</em> &ndash; Keep your ideas around solutions grounded in the reality of the users’ context.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here’s an example of a user scenario:</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Pat, 42, is a senior inspector with Transport Canada. They work in the marine sector and are highly skilled, organized and diligent. They need to document notes and details while on board a naval vessel. They’ve tried using smartphones and tablets but are frustrated by the lack of connectivity and technical issues. They’ve resorted to pen and paper. When they return from an inspection, they typically transcribe their physical notes into the secure system.</p>
                        <p>Ideally, Pat would like an app that allowed them to capture notes and details directly into the secure system while on site. They’d love the app to be simple, easy to use, especially with one hand, and available on a rugged, waterproofed device that included a built-in camera and flash.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Step 5: Maintaining the personas</h3>
                        <p>As roles, capabilities, and technology advance, you should revise your personas throughout the design/product lifecycle. This ensures they remain relevant.
